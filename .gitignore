**Explanation of `.gitignore`:**

* `.vscode/`, `.idea/`, `.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db`: Ignores files specific to code editors or operating systems.
* `node_modules/`: **Very important!** Ignores the huge folder containing development dependencies installed by `npm install`. These should not be on GitHub.
* `config/database.php`: **Crucial for security!** This prevents you from accidentally uploading your database password to a public repository. You should create a `config/database.php.example` file with placeholder credentials and add instructions in a README for others to copy and fill it in.
* `uploads/`: Ignores the folder where user-uploaded images are stored. You don't want these in your code repository.
* `*.log`, `tmp/`: Ignores log files or temporary directories.


1.  **Stage Files:** Tell Git you want to track all the *allowed* files (everything except those in `.gitignore`).
    ```bash
    git add .
    ```
2.  **Commit Files:** Save a snapshot of your project with a descriptive message.
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Initial commit: Add newspaper website project files"
    ```



1.  **Copy the URL:** Go back to the GitHub repository page you created in Step 2. Copy the HTTPS URL provided under "â€¦or push an existing repository from the command line".
2.  **Add Remote:** In your terminal, run this command, replacing the URL with the one you copied:
    ```bash
    git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
    ```
3.  **Verify (Optional):** You can check if the remote was added correctly:
    ```bash
    git remote -v
    ```



1.  **Rename Branch (Standard Practice):** It's common practice to rename the default branch from `master` to `main`.
    ```bash
    git branch -M main
    ```
2.  **Push:** Upload your committed code to GitHub. The `-u` flag sets the upstream branch so you can just use `git push` in the future.
    ```bash
    git push -u origin main
